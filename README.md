Academic Portal is built to find a set of diversified information’s and services for teachers, students and alumni of BMS College of Engineering. A student portal is a commonly used phrase to describe the login page where students can provide a username and password to gain access to an education organization's programs and other learning related materials. Teachers can also use the portal for ease of access to student database such as academic records, etc.

By the implementation of Academic portal, the academic situation of a student has been simplified. Not only the student, but the teacher’s work becomes simpler as well. Previously the student and teacher had to meet in person to get things clear and the data such as marks,student list,etc were stored in papers and was hard to keep track of. All of this becomes easier with the help of the Academic portal. The students and teachers can access this using a computer or a mobile. This web application provides us with ease of access, user friendliness and transparency. On the other hand, form the institution viewpoint, it helps in maintaining transparency, data consistency, data accessibility and ease maintainence.
